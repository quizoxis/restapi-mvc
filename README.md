# REST API using Node and MVC

# Requirements

- nodejs
- express
- mongodb

# Dependencies
`express mongoose body-parser`

`babel-cli babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 nodemon webpack webpack-cli`

- Express.js:  is a node.js frameworks to develop the application.
- Mongoose: is a MongoDB ORM which provides easy to use syntax to query the data from the database.
- body-parser: is used parse all the request coming in the application.
- babel-cli: is used to make our application ES6 code to the backward-compatible version of the javascript.
- webpack: is used to bundle the javascript files for the production.
- nodemon: is used to start our server every time when there is any change in the code. It is only for the development purpose thatâ€™s why we install it into the devDependencies.

# Running

- Start a MongoDB container:

`docker run -d -p 27017-27019:27017-27019 --name mongodb mongo:latest`
